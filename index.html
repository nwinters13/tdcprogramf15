Taking a bold first look at the inevitable 2020 Trump vs Kanye election race, they have combined cutting edge dance moves with the musical stylings of 21st century composers Keith Cozart and Khalif Brown, better known by their stage names, Chief Keef and Swae Lee of Rae Sremmurd. So come with us on a fantasical journey to get presidancey. Described by critics as "... a dance...", prepare yourself to be wowed by The West Wi(n)g.

		<div class="panel-body text-center">Let’s go back in time to all of the good, the bad, the <strong>really</strong> bad, the ugly, and, of course, awkward. The Teenage Dream: A (Really) Wet Hot American Summer wants to relive the memories of adolescence: leaving home for camp, wearing deodorant for the first time, wearing the same shirt for 3 weeks in a row, watching your body ~change~, and crying in a bunk with a bunch of randos who will become friends, frenemies, and potential crushes. Remember the first time you slow danced in a rec center - clammy palms gripping someone else’s sweaty body? Summer isn’t summer without romances—first kisses and uncomfortable, outdoor caresses, and camp significant others who, tbh, you never really liked that much. And of course we cannot forget first periods (SOS what is a tampon!??!?!11/!?!) and first rejections and failures and sweating, lots and lots of sweating. 
		This dance is an interpretive ode to those summer memories that will forever last a lifetime —that time you dreamed about kissing the kid in bunk 27 with mildly bearable mouth gear but you got too nervous and used the “going to brushing my teeth” excuse to run back to bunk 26? Tracing the story through first kisses, first bleedings, first dances, and other “firsts” (and lasts), a conglomeration of uncomfortable interactions, secret crushes, and sloppy sexual experimentation will ensue in the touching story recreated before your eyes. Sit back and try not to remember your own awkward adolescence.

		<div class="panel-body text-center">In the depths of their hunger strikes against the lack of outlets in Carm, there was little more for Mel and Mac to do other than touch themselves (but never each other) to pass the long hours between cheese binges and milk farts. And thus in the depths of our crazed dairy-dreams a great dance was born. The Self Love Dance is for those nights spent pining away by the phone waiting for that special boy to swipe right and settling for a call from your main bitch Helen’s. It’s about loving yourself before you love others, and loving yourself when no one else will.  Although realizing its vision entailed great sacrifices -- Mel had to cut back on cyberbullying her niece on instagram and Mac has 40 unread messages on farmersonly.com -- they remained convinced they were the Edward Snowden’s of masturbation humor, destined to create a national conversation about “basting the ham.” This dance endeavors to show the journey from ordering a 50 gallon barrel of lube off of Amazon Prime to publicly rubbing your nipples to completion in front of what you thought was a Tufts Kink meeting but was actually just a Bio 13 lecture. We would like to thank our dancers/sorority sisters for enthusiastically participating in an elaborate social experiment about homonormic gender performativity and free-for-all pansexuallism. We have all learned a lot along the way. From the utility of flavored lickable wallpaper as a tasty DIY dental dam, to mansplaining the mechanics of female masturbation through visual demonstration, our dancers have never ceased to surprise us. We are endlessly thankful to have ascended in rapture of the healing powers of ham and Rubinoff.

		<div class="panel-body text-center">Shout out to all of the magical food groups out there. We wouldn’t have been able to do it without the help of our wonderful carbs (Morgan, Wyatt, Alyssa, Carolyn, Ian), veggies (Cecily, Sam, Kasey, Shana, Eric), fruits (Annie, Josh S, Cristina), proteins (Noah, Flora, Tory), dairy products (Alex, Josh B, Deb, Nate, Nat), and dessert (Matt Evers). Love you all to pieces and you’re some of the best people we’ll ever meat.
